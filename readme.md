#Amazon clone

This README file provides an overview of the Amazon Clone project, which is a web-based application built using HTML and CSS. The purpose of this project is to create a replica of the popular e-commerce platform Amazon, allowing users to browse products and simulate a simplified shopping experience. 

#Installation
To use the Amazon clone, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
Extract the contents of the ZIP file (if applicable).
Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.
No additional installation steps are required since the project only uses HTML and CSS, which are supported by all modern web browsers.

#Usage
Once you have the project set up, follow these steps to view and interact with the Amazon clone:

Open the index.html file in your web browser.
The browser will load the main page of the Amazon clone.
Browse through the different sections, such as the header, search bar, product listings, and footer.
You can click on products or links to simulate navigation.
Please note that this implementation does not include any backend functionality, such as user authentication or the ability to add items to a shopping cart. It focuses on providing a static representation of the Amazon website's frontend design
